Hello! I'm assuming that you'd like to create a Chrome Extension for the world, or for yourself. Here are the materials you need for making a extension!

Materials:
Google Chrome
A text editor (Notepad is automatically downloaded on Windows, and TextEdit is automatically downloaded on Mac. Those will work, or you can download a fancyone such as my favorite, Sublime Text 3)
A non managed Google Account (Because if you are using a school or work account, they may not allow developer mode.)
A little experience in programming.
And an idea for what kind of extension you'd wish to make.

Go download or get all of these and come back!
I'm assuming you got those items. Let's begin.

Start by opening your text editor. If it doesn't create a file for you by default, hit Ctrl + N or Cmd + N.

Type in this code. I will explain is as we go. If you don't wish to write the code and you would like to not risk getting any mistakes, you can download the file named Manifest.json. Click Ctrl + O or Cmd + O to open the file, then, find the file you are wanting and double click it.
If you want to do it yourself, continue with me.

CODE:
{
The name Chrome Extension is a name I chose, I am not very creative as you can tell. Make the name whatever you'd wish. You can even call it "People Are Weird"!
"name": "Chrome Extension",

This is the version of the extension. For example, if you create a extension and make the version 1.0 and then one month later, you happen to update it. So, you then change it to 1.1. You have to constantly update this for it to be accurate. If you put this in the Chrome Webstore, in the **Additional Information** section next to **Overview** it will show the version you put here.
"version": "1.0",

Next up is the description. This will show up under **Overview**. 
"description": "An Amazing Extension Created by xDiamondx!",

Next is the manifest version, you really don't have to worry much about this though. You can research about this if you'd like.
"manifest_version": 2


Phew! That was a lot of programming! I encourage you to get a drink of water now.
