# Chrome-Extension-Template

### Materials:  
#### Google Chrome  
#### A text editor
such as <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a> or <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a>   
#### A non managed Google Account
(Because if you are using a school or work account, they may not allow developer mode)  
#### A little experience in programming.  
#### And an idea
for what kind of extension you'd wish to make. (In this example, I'll be making a extension that when you click on it, a little popup will come that has the color green. When you are on the website <a href="https://developer.chrome.com">Chrome Developers</a> if you click the green color, it will make the background green.)  
  
You can either program this all by yourself, or you can download my code and tweak it to fit your settings.

I'm Zack. I stumbled over GitHub a few months ago. I had no idea what to do with it, but now I superiorly understand the concepts of GitHub. I enjoy programming, playing Minecraft, and overall gaming.
