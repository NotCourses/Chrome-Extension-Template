# Chrome-Extension-Template

Hello! I'm assuming that you'd like to create a Chrome Extension for the world, or for yourself. Here are the materials you need for making a extension!  

Materials:
Google Chrome
A text editor (Notepad is automatically downloaded on Windows, and TextEdit is automatically downloaded on Mac. Those will work, or you can download a fancyone such as my favorite, Sublime Text 3)  
A non managed Google Account (Because if you are using a school or work account, they may not allow developer mode.)  
A little experience in programming.  
And an idea for what kind of extension you'd wish to make.  

You can either program this all by yourself, or you can download my code and tweak it to fit your settings.

A little about the team:
Owner - xDiamondx  
I'm Diamond. I stumbled over GitHub a few months ago. I had no idea what to do with it, but now I superiorly understand the concepts of GitHub. I enjoy programming, playing Minecraft, and overall gaming.  


If you'd be willing to join the team, ask me!! I always love a good colaborator! You must go to xitzdiamondx.github.io and click on Collaborating.
