# Chrome-Extension-Template
This is a template for all developers searching for a Chrome Extension template.

Use as needed. I will be constalntly updating this when I have time and I will be making comments telling you what that means and what you can change to make it personalized. You will need to learn a little JSON to understand this code. You can search one up on YouTube.
