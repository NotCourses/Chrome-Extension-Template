# Chrome-Extension-Template

Hello! I'm assuming that you'd like to create a Chrome Extension for the world, or for yourself. Here are the materials you need for making a extension!

Materials:
Google Chrome
A text editor (Notepad is automatically downloaded on Windows, and TextEdit is automatically downloaded on Mac. Those will work, or you can download a fancyone such as my favorite, Sublime Text 3)
A non managed Google Account (Because if you are using a school or work account, they may not allow developer mode.)
A little experience in programming.
And an idea for what kind of extension you'd wish to make.

Use as needed. I will be constalntly updating this when I have time and I will be making comments telling you what that means and what you can change to make it personalized. You will need to learn a little JSON to understand this code. You can search one up on YouTube.


A little about the team:

I'm Diamond. I stumbled over GitHub a few months ago. I had no idea what to do with it, but now I superiorly understand the concepts of GitHub. I enjoy programming, playing Minecraft, and overall gaming.


If you'd be willing to join the team, ask me!! I always love a good colaborator! You must agree to the file named ProgrammerAgreements.md
